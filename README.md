Ionic liquids

Supporting data for our studies regarding ionic liquids:

-- Optimal gas-phase structures of six IL-pairs and five individual IL-formin ions obtained using MD simulated annealing technique and further refinement at the DFT/BP86/pVTZ-D3 level. Closer details are given in https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19074308.v1.
